# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently only the newest versions get security updates as security updates are also part of a release.

Only Version 3.1 and later are supported due to the poor code quality of V2.3.0 and different UI before.

| ------- | ------------------ |
| 3.1.X   | ✅                 |
| 3.0.X   | ❎                 |
| 2.3.0   | ❎                 |
| 2.2.0   | ❎                 |
