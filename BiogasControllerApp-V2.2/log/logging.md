What is getting logged? 
Generally this app logs how and when you interact with the app and sometimes, which values you enter. 
No logs are being sent to anybody automatically, you can choose to attach the log file to the bug report.
This helps the devs a lot, as they can better understand the state of the app as it crashed. The logs are 
all found in this folder here.
